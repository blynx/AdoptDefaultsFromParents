# AdoptDefaultsFromParents
Fills fields of new pages with corresponding values of their parents.

## Installation

Either install it manually:

* by moving the folder to your /site/modules directory
* going to the module-page in the processwire admin interface
* hitting the refresh button (the module will appear on top of the page)
* then clicking the install button next to it and follow further instructions

or automatically by one of the options listed here:
http://modules.processwire.com/install-uninstall/

## How to use

In the configuration of this module you have to set templates which are able to give field values and fields which are able to receive values. Then, this module automatically applies field values to every newly added page from their parents according to those settings.

## Namespace for Processwire 3

Namespace is commented out for now, since I use this module in a 2.7 installation. Feel free to uncomment the namespace declaration.
